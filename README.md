# Chatbot
This is my chatbot, made to assist a local baking business.
It answers questions about products, delivery services, and health facts.
I've been working hard on building up the AI and assuring that every possible question has it's own answer, if you like my project, let me know!
# Facebook Frame
I also made a frame for facebook using vectr.com, it's a fun little project that isn't too advanced!
# Storyscape
I created my storyscape, and found that it was really fun to make!
